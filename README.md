        $ sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

#### Running Script
- Run the script 'main.py' in src with arguments , image path and maximum allowed edit distance  
```sh
        $ python3 main.py <img_path> <max_dist>
```
- Example :
```sh
        $ python3 main.py --img_path ../img/test.jpg --max_dist 4
```

#### Things to take care of
- Press Enter 2 Times After selection of ROI From image , otherwise it will generates error
- Put all the disk images that you want to visulize in the menu_item folder with .jpeg extension
- Names of dish images must be same as written in the menu
